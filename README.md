===========

###An Uber Easy Starter Template Engine for Text-based Meme-esque Content Creation. 

Text-based meme template, with a make-it-brand-centric twist. Some light CSS (and js) knowledge required. 


####OVERVIEW

The idea is to have a web designer (i.e., someone who can handle visual aesthetics and CSS) layout a brand-centric design; 
text content is updated by the user / client via a JSON file (read: a text file); 
use a browser add-on / extension for the screen grab;
and then post that image to Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter and the like.


It's not Photoshop! It's a quick KISS tool for publishing branded quotes with minimal friction. That's about it. It's powerful in its own little way. It's an app, not a full-blown do it all application.
